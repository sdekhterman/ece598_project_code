## Current Tasks
1. MNIST Demo
    A. Plot 2D projection                                                                             []
    B. Read H references on how they do the weight initializations                                    [] (might just be the default initialization)/ how many trials are needed for <.> (I might just go through a range until it looks similar to Storm24)
    C. Compute Hs                                                                                     []
    D. Compute Average and Standard deviations of the max LE for N = 20                               []
    E. Plot Average and Standard deviations of the max LE over N = {10 - 120} on a log10 domain scale []
